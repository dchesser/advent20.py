# Advent20.py

My version of [2020's Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2020).
May as well take this time to learn some Python as I never... Well...
I never really took the time to learn it before.
This time of year's as good as any to learn something new.

Literally my first Python program ever.
Coming from a Ruby and Lisp background, it took a lot of understanding
how the Pythonic mindset works before coming to the conclusion (read:
being told repeatedly) that Python is not Lisp and trying to map and
reduce and such with crazy high-order functions will only end in tears.

Many tears were shed after finding out multi-line lambdas are "discouraged".
